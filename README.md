# Random Cluster Generator

A small cluster generator I wrote for my Master's thesis. It creates
random, two-dimensional Gaussian clusters based on the given parameters,
and saves them into text files.

Optionally, it also shows a visualization (scatter plot) of the generated
clusters if `matplotlib` is available.
